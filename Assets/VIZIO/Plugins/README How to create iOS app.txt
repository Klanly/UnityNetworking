In order to build your project for iOS you need to delete Antares.Vizio.UnityEngineBlocks.dll library from the project, and unpack
Antares.Vizio.UnityEngineBlocks.ios.dll from Antares.Vizio.UnityEngineBlocks.ios.dll.zip

Antares.Vizio.UnityEngineBlocks.ios.dll library should be placed into Plugins folder of the project.

This library has a considerable size for the final build of the project. If application size is not important for you - 
you can use it without limitations with licenced version of the Antares Universe Editor.
In order to allow reducing the size of the final application (for those who care about application size) 
a special package will be published on Asset Store, which 
will allow to strip all the unnecessary parts of the library from the project. This can reduce its size by up to 100 times.
